<summary> Abstract </summary>
 In the rapidly evolving landscape of deep learning, the quest for models that
balance expressivity with computational efficiency has never been more
critical. This paper introduces Orchid, a novel architecture that reimagines
sequence modeling by incorporating a new data-dependent convolution mechanism.
Orchid is designed to address the inherent limitations of traditional attention
mechanisms, particularly their quadratic complexity, without compromising the
ability to capture long-range dependencies and in-context learning. At the core
of Orchid lies the data-dependent convolution layer, which dynamically adjusts
its kernel conditioned on input data using a dedicated conditioning neural
network. We design two simple conditioning networks that maintain shift
equivariance in the adaptive convolution operation. The dynamic nature of
data-dependent convolution kernel, coupled with gating operations, grants
Orchid high expressivity while maintaining efficiency and quasilinear
scalability for long sequences. We rigorously evaluate Orchid across multiple
domains, including language modeling and image classification, to showcase its
performance and generality. Our experiments demonstrate that Orchid
architecture not only outperforms traditional attention-based architectures
such as BERT and Vision Transformers with smaller model sizes, but also extends
the feasible sequence length beyond the limitations of the dense attention
layers. This achievement represents a significant step towards more efficient
and scalable deep learning models for sequence modeling.

### Graph Generative Networks
<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
  Most real-world graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure, which is often overlooked by existing graph generation methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph generative network that captures the hierarchical nature of graphs and successively generates the graph sub-structures in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of hierarchy, this model generates communities in parallel, followed by the prediction of cross-edges between communities using separate neural networks. This modular approach enables scalable graph generation for large and complex graphs. 

  
  Moreover, we model the output distribution of edges in the hierarchical graph with a multinomial distribution and derive a recursive factorization for this distribution. This enables us to generate community graphs with integer-valued edge weights in an autoregressive manner. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed generative model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of graph quality across various benchmark datasets.

### Generative Models
<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
  Normalizing flows construct a complex probability density by transforming a simple base density, such as a standard normal distribution, via a chain of smooth, invertible mappings (bijections). Flow-based generative networks can be used to construct high quality generative probabilistic models, but training and sample generation require repeated evaluation of Jacobian determinants and function inverses. In this work, we investigated a set of novel normalizing flows based on circular and symmetric convolutions. It was shown that these transforms admit efficient Jacobian determinant computation and inverse mapping (deconvolution) in ùí™(ùëÅ logùëÅ) time. Based on these invertible convolution filters, a nonlinear data-adaptive convolution transformation was proposed where expressiveness is increased by allowing a layer‚Äôs kernel to adapt to the layers input.

Another outcome of this work was an analytic approach to designing and also better understanding the role of nonlinear gates through the lens of their contribution to latent variables‚Äô distributions. We have shown that specific regularizers, such as sparsity, can be induced on intermediate activations by designing customized pointwise nonlinear gates.

### Deep Generative Multi-View (Multi-Modal) Learning
<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
  We proposed an interpretable deep generative framework for multi-view learning based on a probabilistic formulation of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The model combines a linear multi-view layer in the latent space with deep generative networks as observation models. The proposed model decomposes the variability between views into a shared latent representation that describes the common underlying sources of variation and a set of view-specific components. We designed an efficient learning algorithm using a variational inference procedure incorporating the solution of probabilistic CCA. This also offered a flexible data fusion method in the latent space. Importantly, the proposed model can be generalized to an arbitrary number of views. An empirical analysis confirms that the proposed deep multi-view model can discover subtle relationships between multiple views and recover rich representations.

### Sequence Modelling
<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
  Maximum likelihood is typically considered to be hard in this setting since latent states and transition parameters must be inferred jointly. Given that expectation-maximization does not scale and is prone to local minima, moment-matching approaches from the subspace identification literature have become standard, despite known statistical efficiency issues. In this work, we instead reconsidered likelihood maximization of LDS with generalized-linear observation models. Key to the approach was a reformulation of the LDS model as a two-view convex optimization problem that allowed us to approximate the estimation task as a form of matrix factorization, and hence apply recent global optimization techniques. Furthermore, a novel proximal mapping update was analytically derived for this two-view reformulation that significantly simplified the optimization procedure. The resulting algorithm was simple to use and flexible enough to incorporate different losses and regularizers while empirical studies demonstrated that this estimation strategy outperforms widely-used identification algorithms such as subspace identification methods, both in terms of accuracy and runtime.
